This is a hangman game. It was created as a homework assignment during the UC Davis Extention Bootcamp. The whole program is built using vanilla JavaScript. 

Here is how to play:

1. Press any key to begin
2. Type letters; these are your guesses.
		If the guess is correct, the letter will appear in its appropriate spot on the game. If the guess is wrong, you will lose a chance. 
3. Continue guessing until you either run out of guesses or 
you have guessed the whole word correctly.
4. The words will reset automatically once you either win or exhaust all of your guesses.
