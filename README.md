How to play Hangman:
1. Press any key to begin
2. Type letters; these are your guesses.
		If the guess is correct, the letter will appear in its appropriate spot on the game. If the guess is wrong, you will lose a chance. 
3. Continue guessing until you either run out of guesses or 
you have guessed the whole word correctly.
